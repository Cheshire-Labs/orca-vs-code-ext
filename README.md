# Orca VS Code Extension README

## Overview

The **Orca VS Code Extension** (also referred to as the **Orca IDE**) provides an integrated development environment for creating and managing configuration files for **Orca**, a lab automation scheduler. This extension allows users to edit, validate, and execute **.orca.yml** configuration files directly within **VS Code**.

Orca enables users to define and run workflows for lab automation by coordinating robotic instruments. The VS Code extension simplifies the process by providing tools for editing configurations, managing drivers, and executing workflows/methods within the IDE.

ðŸš€ **Note:** This is a **prototype**. Bugs are expected. 

ðŸ’¬ Feedback is highly encouraged! I want **all feedback**, even if you hate the entire premise of this. Would you use this? Would you never use it? Would you prefer this to be standard Python classes instead of a configuration file? How do we fix lab automation?!  Let me know what works, what doesn't, and what should change. If you have suggestions, reach out at [**support@cheshirelabs.io**](mailto:support@cheshirelabs.io).

## Features

- **YAML Schema Support:** Provides a schema for `*.orca.yml` files to assist in writing valid configurations.
- **Example Workflows:** Includes example workflows for testing.
  - **SMC Assay**: Can be simulated within the IDE.
  - **Venus Demo**: Uses the **Venus Driver** to open **Hamilton Venus**.
- **Driver Management:** Install and uninstall **Orca drivers** from the extension.
- **Workflow & Method Execution:**
  - Load an **.orca.yml** configuration file.
  - Select workflows and methods to execute within the VS Code UI.
  - Define where labware starts and ends (labware must start on a **plate pad**).
- **Logging System:**
  - **Orca Extension Log**: Logs related to the extensionâ€™s operations.
  - **Orca Server Log**: Logs for the Orca server, API calls, etc.
  - **Orca Logs**: Logs showing simulation details.
- **Activity Bar Integration:** Opens with the **Cheshire Labs** logo, providing access to different views:
  - **Workflows View:** Shows workflows in the loaded configuration.
  - **Methods View:** Displays available methods.
  - **Installed Drivers:** Shows installed drivers.
  - **Available Drivers:** Lists drivers that can be installed.

## Installation

1. Install the extension from the **VS Code Marketplace**.
2. Install Orca via pip:
   ```sh
   pip install cheshire-orca
   ```
3. If using the **Venus example**, install the driver:
   ```sh
   pip install orca-driver-venus
   ```
   Alternatively, use the **IDEâ€™s driver install functionality**.
4. Import the **Hamilton Venus** packages by placing them in:
   ```
   C:\Program Files (x86)\HAMILTON\Methods\Cheshire Labs\
   ```

## Using the Extension

### 1. Loading a Configuration File

- Click the **"Load Configuration"** button in the Workflows view.
- Select a `*.orca.yml` file.

### 2. Running a Workflow

- Click the **Play button** next to a workflow.
- Select a **configuration deployment stage** (a dropdown will appear).
- The workflow will run using **Orca**.

### 3. Running a Method

- Click the **Play button** next to a method.
- Select a **configuration deployment stage**.
- Assign start and end locations for **each methodâ€™s expected labware**.

### 4. Installing and Uninstalling Drivers

- **To Install a Driver:** Click the **Download button** in the "Available Drivers" view.
- **To Uninstall a Driver:** Click the **Trash icon** in the "Installed Drivers" view.

### 5. Logging

- View logs from the **Logging Window**.
- Select log type from the dropdown menu.

## Known Limitations

- **Labware cannot start or end on instruments**; they must **start on a plate pad**.
- **The 'Stop' command does not work**; use **'Stop Server'** instead.

## Why Was This Created?

The **Orca VS Code Extension** was built to make lab automation more accessible. Editing configuration files, tracking changes in **git**, and managing workflows within lab automation need to be fixed. However, feedback is crucialâ€”should this:

- Move to the **cloud**?
- Replace **YAML** with standard **Python scripts**?
- Other suggestions?

Lab automation needs to be **fixed**, and your thoughts are welcome! Reach out at [**support@cheshirelabs.io**](mailto\:support@cheshirelabs.io).
